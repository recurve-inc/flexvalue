# Contributing

## Guidelines

- Commit messages should start with a capital letter ("Fix issue with...", not "fix issue with").
- Write new tests and run old tests! Make sure that % test coverage does not decrease.
- Contributions are reviewed by a maintainer before acceptance. To facilitate review, please make a pull request and provide a description and follow the checklist in the pull request template. Contributions without passing tests or with incomplete checklists will not be accepted.
- Prefix new feature branches with `feature/` and bug fix branches with `fix/` and make pull requests directly against `master`.
- Contributions that add new required dependencies to the library will be given a more thorough review to ensure that those dependency additions do not pose a security risk and 2) are absolutely necessary.

## Contributor maintenance responsibility

Contributions of all kinds are encouraged, and we do not require contributors to be responsible for ongoing support of patches they make. However, because we accept "toss over the wall" contributions, contributions deemed by the maintainers to be too difficult to maintain will not be accepted.
